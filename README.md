## Description

We wated to give our users a quick and easy way of planning their christmas shopping. No longer will they have to struggle to remember each person that they have to buy for, inevitably forget a gift they should've gotten, or just flat out ending up spending way too much. Now using our app you can plan out a wishlist, set a price limit, add items, and set reminders for these items. 

We started this project in order to learn how to use React and MongoDB better, as well as test our overall coding knowledge.
